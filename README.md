### Objective

The objective of this task is to demonstrate the process of building, evaluating, and interpreting a simple linear regression model. Here are the specific goals:

### Data Handling:
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
### Model Training:
- Train a simple linear regression model using the training data.
### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
### Prediction:
- Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
### Visualization:
- Visualize the regression line along with the training data.
- Plot the actual vs. predicted values for the test data to assess the model’s accuracy visually.
### Interpretation:
- Interpret the evaluation metrics to understand the model’s performance.
- Draw conclusions based on the visualizations.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **sklearn**: User for splitting data and doing linear regression.

A simple linear regression model on a housing dataset can predict house prices based on key features, aiding in informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, and policymakers.
